# Dining Philosophers Simulation

## Overview
The Dining Philosophers problem is a classic example in computer science that illustrates issues related to concurrency and resource allocation. It involves philosophers sitting around a table, each needing two forks to eat, leading to potential deadlock and starvation scenarios.

## Implementation
This simulation is implemented using HTML5 Canvas for visualization and JavaScript for logic. The simulation visually represents philosophers and forks, allowing users to observe the state changes and interactions.

## Key Features
- **Philosopher States**: Philosophers can be in one of three states - thinking, hungry, or eating.
- **Fork Management**: Forks are shared resources that philosophers must acquire to eat.
- **User Controls**: Users can start, pause, and stop the simulation using buttons.

## Setup and Running
To run the simulation:
1. Ensure you have a web browser that supports HTML5 Canvas.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
3. Use the buttons to control the simulation.
